# Canvas
This is a lightweight library for doing various things with canvases in 2D. It currently only provides a simple painting system, but will likely do more things in the future (export to blob, image, etc; drawing rectangles, triangles, and so on). 


## Why I created this
I plan on using a hidden canvas as a texture map in my X3P editor application, [fix3p](https://github.com/talenfisher/fix3p).  Currently in the works is a painting system for marking areas of vertices.  This is to act as an interface for forwarding drawing coordinates.
